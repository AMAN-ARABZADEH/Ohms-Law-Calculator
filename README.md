# ohmslagkalkylator
As part of my course in embedded systems at university, I created a small calculator to calculate Ohm's Law. The calculator is designed to work specifically with microcontrollers, such as the Arduino Uno, and accurately calculates resistance, voltage, and current based on the user's input values.

 Its compact design and ease of use make it a valuable tool for anyone working with microcontrollers, whether they are beginners or experienced professionals.

Whether you're an electronics enthusiast or an electrical engineering student, this calculator is a useful tool to have in your arsenal. It simplifies the calculations needed for Ohm's Law, making it easier to focus on other aspects of your project. Overall, this calculator is an excellent example of the practical applications of embedded systems, and it has been a valuable asset in my studies.
